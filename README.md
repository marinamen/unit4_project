- For our Unit 4 and final G11 CS project we were tasked with re-creating a online board system such as reddit. Solely evaluated using Criteria C, D and E using a MVP.
- In accordance with this I chose to develop a redesign that would solely surround fashion, I got some inspiration from Pinterest *[1]*


## Success Criteria 

Create a Flask Web application for an online bulletin board system (like reddit). You are free to set the general theme, groups, visuals (CSS), topics, etc, but you need:

**1. A login/registration system, hashed of course.**

**2. A posting system to EDIT/CREATE/DELETE comments.**

**3. A system to add/remove likes.**

**4. A system to follow/unfollow users, follow/unfollow topics or groups.**

**5. A profile page with relevant information**

**6. [HLs] upload images**

**7. [HL++] send emails**
